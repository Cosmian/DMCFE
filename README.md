# DMCFE
Implementation of the DMCFE algorithm

## TODO

- optimize IPFE
- optimize BSGS:
	+ parallelize?
	+ try to change the recurring computation of `g^n` into a non-recurring suite.
	+ implement better exponentiation
- implement functional tests
- complete bibliography
- complete README and notes
